# Rock, Paper, Scissors CodeCademy Project
This project implements the classical two player rock paper scissors game. The user makes a choice, the computer generates a choice, the results are compared and the winner is decided. The possible outcomes are: 
- Rock destroys scissors (rock wins against scissors).
- Scissors cut paper (scissors wins against paper).
- Paper covers rock (paper wins against rock).
- If thereâ€™s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

The user has a secret cheatcode 'bomb' which makes the user win no matter the computer choice.
